# PiRower
PiRower is a python racing game for a rowing machine which runs on a Raspberry Pi. 

# To use this software
This software will only work with:-
 - a rowing machine similar with a Delta Air Rower. 
 - A pi3b+ or better running Raspberry Pi OS

# 
A small magnet must be added attached to the rowing machine.
This software also requires a custom made hardware device. No real details of this device are being logged here as it is not expected that anyone will actually attempt to build and run this except me!
However the device is simply a device that has 3 hall effect (magnet) sensors that collect the rowing stroke information and also information from the flywheel.
The schematics in the DATA_COLLECTOR folder hold more clues. On mine I have also attached a hobbyist 4x4 membrane panel switch and a DS3231 RTC module.
