# PiRower
PiRower is a python racing game for a rowing machine which runs on a Raspberry Pi. This project is something that I have put together in my spare time to learn Python and create a cool game I can play when using my rowing machine.

# To use this software
To use this software you will need:-
 - A rowing machine that is compatible with a Delta Air Rower. My machine is about 20 years old. I have no idea if it is still available although similar looking machines exist so good luck with that.
 - If that hasn't put you off then you will also need to make a device to collect all the user input and supply it to the Pi.
 - You'll need Raspian Jessie. It also works on Stretch, but Stretch doesn't have some of the fonts installed that Jessie has so the graphics look a bit odd.
 - A pi2 or better.

# Making the Data Collection Thing
To build the data collection thing you will need 
- 3 x IR Break Beam sensors
- 1 x 5x7 Protoboard
- 3 x LEDs
- 3 x Resistors (doesn't matter which, but probably 330's )
- 4 x M3 Standoffs
- 4 x 40mm M4 Standoffs
- Some male and female pin headers
- Two 3mm MDF circles about 150mm in diameter.
- 5 x 1mm N35 neodymium magnets (to attach the device to the rower).

The idea is that you have a plastic disc with a thin strip of aluminium foil on it which attaches to the side of the rower and rotates in time with the rowing action. As the disc rotates it passes through the IR break beams and an algorithm in the code can replicate the rowing action onscreen. The disc is held onto the Rower with an N35 Neodymium magnet.

The flywheel and the keypad plug into the data collection device so all the data is collected centrally and relayed to the Pi via a 40 pin GPIO cable.
